# The-Falling

The Falling is a Space Invaders style Arcade Game. The assets for this game were first developed as part of an Android app. The buggy app (Powered by a terrible game engine written by an ignorant college freshman) lived on the Google PlayStore for a few years until it was ported to a web app. 

## How To Play

Use the arrow keys to move the spacecraft and the space key to shoot the invaders. Defend the Earth and the spacecraft from the falling invaders for as long as possible.

## Running The Game From Source

The game is a simple web app that can be run by simply opening up `./public/index.html` in your favorite web browser.

To run the simple `Node.js` server:

* Install `Node.js`
* In your terminal, navigate to to this project's root directory and run `npm i && npm start`

## Contributing and Pending Improvements

If for some reason you would like to build upon this silly little game, send a PR!

Some things I'd like to add are:

* Add support for mobile devices
* Newer mechanics, power ups, topical sprites
* A story mode?
